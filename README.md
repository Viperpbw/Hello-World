# Hello-World
On-line Harvard computer class CS50 submissions

Hi there.  This is Paul.  I am a computer idiot - maybe because the last programming I did was in college where I learned (dont laugh) fortran, pascal and input most of my programs via card readers onto our very sophisticated HP mainframe computer.  I know all of the office suite stuff well, but not programming in the modern era.  As a 61 year old CEO, I thought it might be interesting to learn about programming in the way my employees know it, not to replace them but to talk more of their language.  I can teach them board room financials, but I am trying to learn (sincerely) about programming languages.
Enough shit - time to move forward.
I would enjoy moon tacos.
